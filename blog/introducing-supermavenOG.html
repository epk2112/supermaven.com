              <center><em>See below for details.</em></center>
              <p>
                Code completion has come a long way. When I created TabNine in
                2018, the first tool to use deep learning for code completion,
                there were few developer tools that used AI. The models were
                small, the capabilities were limited, and people were skeptical
                that the tools were useful enough to be worth paying for.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since then, AI coding tools have been widely adopted: GitHub
                recently
                <a
                  href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/microsoft-github-copilot-revenue-100-million-ARR-ai"
                  >announced</a
                >
                that its tool Copilot had reached $100 million in annual
                recurring revenue. Millions of developers now use AI tools every
                day. This adoption is driven by the deployment of large models
                with tens of billions of parameters that are much more useful
                than the models of 2018.
              </p>
              <p>
                Given that code completion has &quot;gone mainstream&quot;,
                given the growing size of the largest language models, and given
                the enormous costs involved in training the largest models, it
                raises the question: is there still room for small startups? Has
                code completion become the exclusive province of large players
                like Microsoft or Google?
              </p>
              <p>
                At Supermaven we believe the question is not yet settled. The
                reason is the high serving costs of large models. While a model
                like GPT-4 offers unmatched suggestion quality, it&#x27;s
                impossible to run on every keystroke (unless you charge users
                $1,000/month). Today, the deployment of an AI coding tool is
                limited just as much by the cost of the GPUs to run the tool as
                by the cost to develop the tool itself. That&#x27;s why Copilot
                has
                <a
                  href="https://thakkarparth007.github.io/copilot-explorer/posts/copilot-internals.html#preventing-poor-requests-via-contextual-filter"
                  >made efforts</a
                >
                to reduce costs by limiting the contexts in which they offer
                suggestions.
              </p>
              <p>
                The high cost of serving a code completion tool levels the
                playing field: it means that everyone, whether a small startup
                or Microsoft, must use a small model to remain profitable. The
                best product is the one which uses a small model most
                effectively.
              </p>
              <p>So how is Supermaven different?</p>
              <h3 id="300000-token-context-window">
                300,000-token context window
              </h3>
              <p>
                The context window of a code completion model determines how
                much of your code it can take into account when making its
                suggestions. A long context window is crucial to delivering good
                completions - that&#x27;s why Copilot
                <a
                  href="https://github.blog/changelog/2023-08-28-github-copilot-august-28th-update/#expanding-copilots-context-window-to-8k"
                  >recently expanded</a
                >
                its context window to 8,192 tokens.
              </p>
              <p>
                At Supermaven we&#x27;ve developed and trained from scratch a
                new neural network architecture which is more efficient than a
                Transformer (the current standard architecture) at integrating
                information across a long context window. This allows us to
                offer a 300,000-token context window while keeping the cost and
                latency the same as a Transformer with a 4,000-token context
                window.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a user, that means that after Supermaven spends 10-20 seconds
                processing your repository, it will become familiar with your
                APIs and the unique conventions of your codebase. That fixes one
                of the most common complaints about Copilot: that while
                it&#x27;s great at working with well-known APIs and libraries
                that have good coverage in the training data, it struggles with
                the large, idiosyncratic codebases that you get when using it
                for real work.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here&#x27;s a simple example of the difference that a
                300,000-token context window makes. In this example, I ran
                Supermaven and Copilot on the same code and asked them to
                generate a function called <code>doubleIndentation</code> taking
                a value of type <code>Indentation</code>. Because the
                <code>Indentation</code> struct isn&#x27;t defined or used
                anywhere in the file, Copilot doesn&#x27;t have any information
                about it in context, so it generates code that doesn&#x27;t
                compile. Supermaven generates correct code because its context
                window is large enough to fit the entire 50,000-token
                repository.
              </p>

              <h3 id="speed">Speed</h3>
              <p>
                Supermaven is fast: we&#x27;ve built custom infrastructure to
                keep it responsive while working with the long prompts that come
                with large codebases.
              </p>
              <p>
                I designed a simple test to compare Supermaven to the
                competition. To ensure each tool has the prompt in cache, I
                started with a context where every tool agrees the most likely
                completion is <code>for (let i</code>. Then I typed
                <code>for (let j</code>, forcing each tool to generate a new
                completion, and measured the number of frames between the
                appearance of &#x27;j&#x27; on the screen and the appearance of
                the completion. Here are the results:

              <p>
                Unlike most code assistants, Supermaven doesn&#x27;t see your
                code as a sequence of files. Instead, Supermaven sees the
                sequence of edits you&#x27;ve made to your codebase - similar to
                what you&#x27;d see if you ran <code>git diff</code>. This helps
                Supermaven quickly understand what you&#x27;re trying to
                accomplish, and it&#x27;s great for refactoring. Here are some
                examples:
